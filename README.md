# Something Phishy is Going on Here
 
### By Joe Altvater
 
In this project you will find a nearly completely cloned Pitt login page with some malicious abilities. The point of this project was to see just how easy it is to replicate a trusted website and use it to phish out user information. What I learned from this project is that site replication is incredibly easy and manipulating the code so that it completes malicious tasks is also quite easy. I was able to just download and copy the Pitt login page through the inspect element. I then manipulated the code by using PHP to save the username of the targeted student and post it to the survey page afterwards. After creating the survey page using HTML and CSS I used a service called DigitalOcean to host my site. DigitalOcean is a free service to students with GitHub Pro and it was pretty easy to set up. I obtained a free site domain through the website DOT tk which allows for anyone to obtain free .tk domains. I then created a mySQL database to send the saved user information to and collect with hopes that I would be able to draw a conclusion of which groups are more susceptible to these types of attacks based on metrics such as what year of college they are in, their gender, and ethnicity. What I also learned is that actually sending this malicious link to people and allowing for the most effective implementation is nearly impossible. The major obstacle was that in order to meet the ethical guidelines, I would need to obtain informed consent of the people who were going to test the link first. The problem is that the point of an experiment like this is to see how susceptible a Pitt student is to a malicious link that is disguised. If I were to clearly inform the student about the link beforehand, it would affect how the students interact with it and maybe make them more aware of the intent. Overall I was happy to learn about the process of site creation and manipulation and think that with more time I couldâ€™ve figured out a way to obtain informed consent while also maintaining the authenticity of the experiment.
